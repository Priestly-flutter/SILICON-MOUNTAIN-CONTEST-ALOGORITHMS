Angular Sort:

This is a sorting algorithm that sorts are 2D array in an Angular manner that's 
  =======>it simultaneously sorts from the first column and last row 
        1               2               3               4               5    ||
        6               7               8               9               10   ||  
        11              12              13              14              15   \/
        16              17              18              19              20
        21              22              23              24              25

how does the Angular sorting algorithm works:
==>it simultaneously sorts from the first column and last row.
